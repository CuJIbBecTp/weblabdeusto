This library can be used to easily implement new experiments using the C++
programming language.

Currently the library has been tested on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++
2008 and Ubuntu GNU/Linux with GNU g++. Prebuilt binaries for this Microsoft
Windows are included in the win32 folder, for both Debug and Release.

Nonetheless, the library should compile on any standard C++ compiler, as long as
the libraries it depends on are available (mainly xmlrpc-c, see below).


*** USING THE LIBRARY ON WINDOWS VC++ 2008 ***

New experiments can be based on the cpp_microserver_dummy project (which can be
found on the win32 folder).
This experiment simply links to the library and declares a class which inherits
from the abstract ExperimentServer, overriding the following events:

	virtual std::string onStartExperiment() = 0;
	virtual std::string onSendFile(std::string const & encoded_file, std::string const & fileinfo) = 0;
	virtual std::string onSendCommand(std::string const & command) = 0;
	virtual std::string onDispose() = 0;
	
Once an instance of the new class has been created and launched (through the
launch member function), the server will listen for connections and the virtual
member functions above will be automatically called as requests are received.


*** COMPILING & DEPENDENCIES ***

This library depends on the xmlrpc-c library. Though theorethically you should
be able to use any version of it, older versions don't seem to support windows
properly. The prebuilt binaries are linked against the xmlrpc-c "advanced"
version from their repository.


*** KNOWN BUGS ***

Seems to crash under certain situations, especially if there are a high number
of simultaneous connections to the server.
