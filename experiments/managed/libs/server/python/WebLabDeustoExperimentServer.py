"""
There are two ways of implementing an Experiment Server in
Python:
 
 * Using the WebLab infrastructure (see weblab.experiment.experiments)
  
 * As standalone simple applications, as this one
 
The advantage of the first approach is that the developer has access
to all the tools provided by voodoo, including the deployment tools.
An experiment developed this way can be in the same process as the 
Laboratory Server, or communicate in a faster way.

However, the second approach is far simpler for a programmer not 
involved or new to the WebLab-Deusto project.
 
In order to use the second approach, you should make a class that
inherits from ExperimentServer, and use the launch method to run it :-)
