Download using git
==================

Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(To be written. There are different approaches. The most common for those interested in submitting patches is to create a github account and use `github for windows <http://windows.github.com/>`_. For only downloading the system, applications such as `TortoiseGit <http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/>`_ exist. We'll document here a step-by-step tutorial for the later)

UNIX systems (Linux, Mac OS X)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(To be written, but basically install git, do the following::

  git clone https://github.com/porduna/weblabdeusto.git

And enjoy)
