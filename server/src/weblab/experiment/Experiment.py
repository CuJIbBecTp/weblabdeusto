        # the user to say when the session should finish), it will never be asked.

        # It will be a numeric + string value where the numeric value is:
        #  - result > 0: It has not finished, and this is a stimation of how
        #                long will it take. For instance, it can return that
        #                it will take 3 seconds if it does not know how long
