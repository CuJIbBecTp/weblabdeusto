# The Independent Scheduler Aggregator aggregates different 
# schedulers that schedule independent resources. For 
# instance, one experiment that can be executed in two 
# different types of "rigs" will be waiting in two queues
# at the same time. This class will handle established 
# policies such as priorities among schedulers.
# 
# Take into account that a possible scheduler is an external
# scheduler (such as another WebLab-Deusto). Therefore 
# policies can become complex here.
# 
# Therefore, while it is compliant with the Scheduler 
# API, it can not be configured as such in the core config
# files: it will be created by the coordinator in the 
# constructor, creating one per experiment_id.
