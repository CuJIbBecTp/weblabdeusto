# The Independent Scheduler Aggregator aggregates different 
# schedulers that schedule independent resources. For 
# instance, one experiment that can be executed in two 
# different types of "rigs" will be waiting in two queues
# at the same time. This class will handle established 
# policies such as priorities among schedulers.
# 
# Take into account that a possible scheduler is an external
# scheduler (such as another WebLab-Deusto). Therefore 
# policies can become complex here.
# 
# In summary, IndependentSchedulerAggregator is an 'OR' 
# aggregator, since it reserves in all the aggregated
# schedulers and then it it responds with the best option.
# 
# Therefore, while it is compliant with the Scheduler 
# API, it can not be configured as such in the core config
# files: it will be created by the coordinator in the 
# constructor, creating one per experiment_id.

# The SharedSchedulerAggregator is a scheduler aggregator
# for resources being shared through more than one 
# scheduler. We could say that it is an 'AND' scheduler:
# it reserves only in one scheduler.
# 
# An interesting use case for this class is if an 
# experiment can be shared through queues and booking. 
# Depending on the reservation, it will only call one of
# the schedulers (the most appropriate). But whenever we
# want to know free slots or position in a queue, we 
# have to ask all the aggregated systems.
# 
# Another possible use case for this class would be 
# sharing a single experiment through different mechanisms,
# such as weblabdeusto and an external one (VISIR, iLabs,
# Sahara). One of the schedulers would check in the 
# internal database and define whether it is possible to
# serve the experiment or not
