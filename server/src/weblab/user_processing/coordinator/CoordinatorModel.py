# An experiment is the software system that behaves as the student expects. The

# "exp1:ud-binary@Electronics experiments", which use the same CPLD as 
# "exp1:ud-pld@PLD experiments", or it uses "exp2:ud-binary@Electronics experiments"

# Given an experiment type, one can find all the resource types accessing all the 
# experiment instances of the experiment type, and for each experiment instance
# checking the resource type of the resource instance associated to the experiment
# instance. However, if there are reservations and the experiment instance is 
# suddenly removed due to maintainance or whatever, given a reservation_id the 
# system will not know how to achieve the resource type since that path has been
# broken. Due to this, this aparently redundant table is built when the experiment
# instances are added.
