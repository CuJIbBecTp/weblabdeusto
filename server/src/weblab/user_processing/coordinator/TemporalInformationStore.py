    The coordinator will be asking the experiment whether it has finished or not.
    Given that this process is not synchronized with the UserProcessingManager, not 
    even with the user session (if an experiment takes a long time and the user 
    session has finished, we still want to store the results of that experiment).
    Therefore, this store will store the information. From time to time, the 
    UserProcessingManager will call this store to ask for information to store in
    the database. This class provides synchronized solution, so the UPS will be 
    able to get blocked until some information is available.
