"""
This module contains the Login Server. This server will only
manage the authentication (and not the authorization) of the 
users. To this end, it defines that there are two interfaces:

 * One for those systems that can be checked with typical credentials (e.g.,
   using a username a password). Examples of this would be a regular database,
   a LDAP server, or a set of constraints such as "is the user coming from 
   this IP address?". This interface is called "SimpleAuthn".

 * The system, which manages that there is an external system that manages
   the authentication, and some external protocol is required. Examples of this
   are OAuth, OpenID or similar. They all require using a web interface. This
   interface is called "WebProtocolAuthn".

The LoginServer manages both interfaces.
