#     ZSI and PyExpat
#
# Description:
# 
#   ZSI used to use PyXML for parsing XML. This library
#   is really old, deprecated and doesn't count with 
#   compilations for many platforms. However, its 
#   functionality comes with the default Python Library,
#   so it should actually try to use this one instead of
#   PyXML. Actually, in the SVN they have started to use
#   it, but this change is not available in most
#   distributions. Due to this, we make ZSI use this
#   implementation.
#

#     xmlrpclib and object serialization
#
# Description:
# 
#  xmlrpclib is the default XML-RPC library, which comes
#  with the Python Standard Library. This library 
#  couldn't serialize "object"s until Python 2.6, so 
#  everyone using Python 2.5 will not be able to do it. 
# For this reason, we correct the problem here.
# 
# Further technical description:
#  Before Python 2.6, if an object is given to              
#  xmlrpclib.Marshaller.__dump, it doesn't understand       
#  that it's an instance, so it can't marshall it. In       
#  order to avoid this, we replace this method in previous  
#  versions of Python. Right now we support Python 2.5.
#                                                          
#  So, _new__dump will replace __dump
#
