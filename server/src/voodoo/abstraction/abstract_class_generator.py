        class MyClass( AbstractClass(['method1','method2']) ):
            #whatever
        
        The problem is that as the type is dynamically generated, you can't call it from a
        constructor. Well, you can always do:
    
        AC = AbstractClass(['method1','method2'])
        
        class MyClass( AC ):
            def __init__(self):
                AC.__init__(self)
            #whatever
            
        But then the code looses its readibility. To avoid this problem, you can use this 
        function (call_abstract_constructors), providing the classType from where you are
        calling the function, the new instance, an, optionally, a method which will handle
        the unimplemented methods.
        
        It should be used as:
        
        class MyClass ( AbstractClass( ['method1','method2'] ) ):
            def __init__(self):
                call_abstract_constructors( MyClass, self )
            #whatever
            
        to ensure that you are calling the constructor.
        
        If for whatever the reason, you inherit from more than one AbstractClass, this 
        function will call the constructor of every AbstractClass. For example:
                
        class MyClass ( AbstractClass( ['method1','method2'] ), AbstractClass( ['method3','method4'] ) ):
            def __init__(self):
                call_abstract_constructors( MyClass, self) #Enogh for both AbstractClasses
    """
    for i in classType.__bases__:
        if __DEEPEST_CLASS in i.__bases__:
